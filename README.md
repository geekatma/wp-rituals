# Description
This is a wordpress repository that tries to eliminate all the frequently repeated tasks (rituals) while playing around with wordpress. It takes care of some of the basic stuff like Login Box Customization, Resizing of Images etc.

This one is not original. This is basically the re-implementation of a plugins tutorial (scotch tutorial) How To Build a Wordpress Plugin (https://scotch.io/tutorials/how-to-build-a-wordpress-plugin-part-1). Just following along tweaking it here and there (just to feel clever) - My first ever experience with building a wordpress plugin - (actually first time doing something on PHP etc)
# Note
Hope it gets me somewhere.
